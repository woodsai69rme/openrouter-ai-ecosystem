## What Didn't Work

### Technical Challenges

#### Performance Issues
- **Database Query Optimization**: Underestimated complexity of data relationships
  - **Impact**: 3-week delay in launch due to performance problems
  - **Root Cause**: Insufficient performance testing with realistic data volumes
  - **Cost**: $25,000 in additional optimization work
  - **Lesson**: Performance testing should start early with production-like data

- **Third-party Integration**: API limitations discovered late
  - **Impact**: Had to build workaround solution, adding 2 weeks
  - **Root Cause**: Insufficient research of API capabilities during planning
  - **Cost**: $15,000 in additional development
  - **Lesson**: Thoroughly evaluate third-party services before committing

#### Scalability Concerns
- **Session Management**: Redis implementation caused memory issues
  - **Impact**: System instability during peak usage
  - **Root Cause**: Underestimated session data size and retention needs
  - **Resolution**: Migrated to database-backed sessions
  - **Lesson**: Load test all components, not just application logic

### Process Failures

#### Requirements Management
- **Scope Creep**: Requirements changed significantly during development
  - **Impact**: 30% increase in development time
  - **Root Cause**: Insufficient stakeholder alignment during planning
  - **Examples**: 15 major feature changes requested mid-development
  - **Lesson**: Invest more time in upfront requirements gathering

- **User Research**: Limited user feedback during development
  - **Impact**: Major UX changes required after beta testing
  - **Root Cause**: Assumed user needs without validation
  - **Cost**: 3 weeks of redesign work
  - **Lesson**: Involve users throughout development, not just at the end

#### Communication Gaps
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Inconsistent communication led to misaligned expectations
  - **Impact**: Stakeholder surprise about timeline delays
  - **Root Cause**: No formal communication plan
  - **Resolution**: Implemented weekly stakeholder reports
  - **Lesson**: Proactive communication prevents relationship issues

### Team Challenges

#### Resource Constraints
- **Designer Availability**: Single designer became bottleneck
  - **Impact**: UI development delayed by 2 weeks
  - **Root Cause**: Underestimated design complexity
  - **Resolution**: Brought in contract designer
  - **Lesson**: Identify potential bottlenecks early and plan alternatives

- **Knowledge Silos**: Critical knowledge concentrated in few team members
  - **Impact**: Risk of delays when key people were unavailable
  - **Root Cause**: Insufficient knowledge sharing practices
  - **Resolution**: Implemented pair programming and documentation requirements
  - **Lesson**: Actively work to distribute knowledge across team

#### Burnout Risk
- **Overtime Culture**: Extended hours became normalized
  - **Impact**: Team satisfaction decreased, quality issues increased
  - **Root Cause**: Unrealistic timeline pressure
  - **Resolution**: Adjusted timeline and hired additional resources
  - **Lesson**: Sustainable pace is essential for long-term success
