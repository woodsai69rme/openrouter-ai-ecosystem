## Valuation Framework Overview

### Multi-Method Approach

We employ a weighted average of four primary valuation methodologies to ensure comprehensive and accurate valuation:

| Method | Weight | Rationale | Applicability |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Revenue Multiple | 40% | Industry standard for SaaS/tech companies | High |

| Asset-Based | 10% | Conservative floor valuation | Low |

### Valuation Principles

1. **Market-Based Approach**: Leverage market data and comparable transactions
2. **Fundamental Analysis**: Focus on underlying business fundamentals
3. **Growth Consideration**: Account for growth trajectory and scalability
4. **Risk Adjustment**: Incorporate business and market risks
5. **Conservative Estimates**: Use conservative assumptions where uncertain

## Method 1: Revenue Multiple Valuation

### Methodology Overview

The revenue multiple method values the company based on its revenue relative to industry benchmarks and comparable companies. This method is particularly relevant for high-growth technology companies.

### Data Collection

#### Company Financial Data
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**: $[X] million
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: $[X] thousand
- **Revenue Growth Rate**: [X]% year-over-year
- **Revenue Quality**: [X]% recurring revenue
- **Customer Concentration**: Top 10 customers = [X]% of revenue

#### Industry Multiple Research

**Public Company Multiples**
| Company | Revenue ($M) | Market Cap ($M) | Revenue Multiple | Growth Rate | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| [Public Comp 1] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]x | [X]% | [Similar business model] |
| [Public Comp 2] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]x | [X]% | [Different scale] |
| [Public Comp 3] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]x | [X]% | [Different market] |
| **Median** | **$[X]** | **$[X]** | **[X]x** | **[X]%** | |

**Private Company Multiples**
| Company | Last Round | Valuation ($M) | Revenue ($M) | Multiple | Stage |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------|-------|
| [Private Comp 1] | Series B | $[X] | $[X] | [X]x | Similar |
| [Private Comp 2] | Series A | $[X] | $[X] | [X]x | Earlier |
| [Private Comp 3] | Series C | $[X] | $[X] | [X]x | Later |
| **Median** | | **$[X]** | **$[X]** | **[X]x** | |

### Multiple Selection Process

#### Base Multiple Determination
- **Industry Median**: [X]x revenue
- **Stage-Appropriate Multiple**: [X]x revenue
- **Growth-Adjusted Multiple**: [X]x revenue
- **Selected Base Multiple**: [X]x revenue

#### Multiple Adjustments

**Premium Factors (+)**
1. **Superior Growth Rate**: +[X]% ([Our growth] vs [industry average])
2. **High Recurring Revenue**: +[X]% ([X]% recurring vs [industry average])
3. **Strong Unit Economics**: +[X]% (LTV/CAC ratio advantage)
4. **Market Leadership**: +[X]% (competitive position)
5. **Technology Differentiation**: +[X]% (unique technology advantages)

**Discount Factors (-)**
1. **Customer Concentration**: -[X]% (concentration risk)
2. **Market Competition**: -[X]% (competitive pressure)
3. **Execution Risk**: -[X]% (team/operational risks)
4. **Market Size**: -[X]% (limited addressable market)

**Net Adjustment**: +[X]% premium to base multiple

#### Final Multiple Calculation
```
Adjusted Multiple = Base Multiple × (1 + Net Adjustment)
= [X]x × (1 + [X]%)
= [X]x

Revenue Multiple Valuation = ARR × Adjusted Multiple
= $[X]M × [X]x
= $[X]M
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

| Revenue Multiple | Valuation ($M) | Scenario |
|------------------|----------------|----------|
| [X-1]x | $[X] | Conservative |
| [X]x | $[X] | Base Case |
| [X+1]x | $[X] | Optimistic |

## Method 2: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Methodology

The DCF method values the company based on the present value of projected future cash flows, providing a fundamental view of intrinsic value.

### Financial Model Assumptions

#### Revenue Projections

**Growth Assumptions**
- **Year 1 Growth**: [X]% (based on current trajectory)
- **Year 2-3 Growth**: [X]% (market expansion phase)

- **Customer Retention**: [X]% annual retention rate
- **ARPU Growth**: [X]% annual increase
- **Market Expansion**: [X] new markets/segments

#### Cost Structure Projections

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
- **Current COGS Margin**: [X]% of revenue
- **Projected COGS Margin**: [X]% (improving with scale)
- **Key Cost Drivers**: [Infrastructure, support, third-party services]

**Operating Expenses**
- **Sales & Marketing**: [X]% of revenue (decreasing with scale)
- **R&D**: [X]% of revenue (maintaining innovation)
- **General & Administrative**: [X]% of revenue (economies of scale)

#### Capital Requirements

### DCF Model Construction

#### 5-Year Financial Projections

| Year | Revenue ($M) | EBITDA ($M) | EBIT ($M) | FCF ($M) | Growth Rate |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 2024 | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% |
| 2025 | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% |
| 2026 | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% |
| 2027 | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% |
| 2028 | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% |

#### Discount Rate Calculation (WACC)

**Cost of Equity (using CAPM)**
- **Risk-Free Rate**: [X]% (10-year Treasury)
- **Market Risk Premium**: [X]% (equity market premium)
- **Beta**: [X] (industry/comparable company beta)
- **Cost of Equity**: [X]% = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta × Market Premium)

**Cost of Debt**
- **Current Debt**: $[X] million
- **Interest Rate**: [X]%
- **Tax Shield**: [X]% tax rate
- **After-Tax Cost of Debt**: [X]%

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital**
```
WACC = (E/V × Cost of Equity) + (D/V × Cost of Debt × (1-Tax Rate))
Where:
- E = Market value of equity
- D = Market value of debt
- V = E + D

WACC = ([X]% × [X]%) + ([X]% × [X]% × (1-[X]%))
= [X]%
```

#### Terminal Value Calculation

**Gordon Growth Model**
```
Terminal Value = FCF(Year 5) × (1 + Terminal Growth) / (WACC - Terminal Growth)
= $[X]M × (1 + [X]%) / ([X]% - [X]%)
= $[X]M
```

**Terminal Multiple Method (Cross-Check)**
```
Terminal Value = EBITDA(Year 5) × Terminal Multiple
= $[X]M × [X]x
= $[X]M
```

#### Present Value Calculation

**Present Value of Cash Flows**
| Year | FCF ($M) | PV Factor | Present Value ($M) |
|------|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| 2024 | $[X] | 0.XXX | $[X] |
| 2025 | $[X] | 0.XXX | $[X] |
| 2026 | $[X] | 0.XXX | $[X] |
| 2027 | $[X] | 0.XXX | $[X] |
| 2028 | $[X] | 0.XXX | $[X] |
| **Total PV of FCF** | | | **$[X]** |

**Present Value of Terminal Value**
```
PV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)^5
= $[X]M / (1 + [X]%)^5
= $[X]M
```

**Enterprise Value**
```
Enterprise Value = PV of FCF + PV of Terminal Value
= $[X]M + $[X]M
= $[X]M
```

**Equity Value**
```
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt + Cash
= $[X]M - $[X]M + $[X]M
= $[X]M
```

### DCF Sensitivity Analysis

| WACC \ Terminal Growth | [X-1]% | [X]% | [X+1]% |
|------------------------|--------|------|--------|
| [X-1]% | $[X]M | $[X]M | $[X]M |
| [X]% | $[X]M | $[X]M | $[X]M |
| [X+1]% | $[X]M | $[X]M | $[X]M |

= $[X]M × [X]x
= $[X]M
```

- **Deferred Revenue**: $[X]
- **Other Long-term Liabilities**: $[X]
- **Total Long-term Liabilities**: $[X]

### Net Asset Value Calculation

```
Total Assets = Tangible Assets + Intangible Assets
= $[X] + $[X]
= $[X]

Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities + Long-term Liabilities
= $[X] + $[X]
= $[X]

Net Asset Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
= $[X] - $[X]
= $[X]
```
